	N entries (variable size), consisting of header (20 bytes) and subentries (12 bytes each):
	header (20 bytes):
	0x00-0x01: 	number of subentries M (little endian)
	0x02-0x03: 	type (little endian), see table in Appendix B
	0x04-0x11:	object type specific data
			e.g. entrance: "Again, I haven't tested it, but it looks like in the object (not subobject, the main object)'s data, for an entrance, the little-endian word at offset 4 is the x-offset, and at offset 6 the y-offset.  That is, take the object's position in the level, and add the given x- and y-offsets, and I think that's the initial position for a lemming coming out of that entrance."
			e.g. fling objects (type 0x0c): little endian words at offset 6 and 8 respectively are the x and y fling velocity; offset 9 bit1 means permanent animation, bit 0 invert velocity for lems facing left
	0x12-0x13:	sound effect ID (little endian)
		M component-subentries (components that make up the object) (12 bytes each):
			note: might not fully apply if the subentry refers to a special sprite not defined in L2BI
		0x00:		interaction type (see appendix D)
		0x01:		bitfield
			bit0:		unused (not set)
			bit1:		unused (not set)
			bit2:		only set for steam objects in sports tribe
			bit3:		interaction flag (?)
			bit4:		vertical extensibility flag: repeat component if vertical extension requested (ref. L2BO section of level file)
			bit5:		horizontal extensibility flag: repeat component if horizontal extension requested (ref. L2BO section of level file)
			bit6:		relative x flag: if 0, interpret subobject x position as measured from the (x, y) given in the level data for object.  If 1 and not the first subpart of the object, interpret subobject x position as measured from the upper-left of the previous subpart.  If first object subpart and this bit is 1, ignore subobject x position and use 0.
			bit7:		relative y flag: if 0, interpret subobject y position as measured from the (x, y) given in the level data for object.  If 1 and not the first subpart of the object, interpret subobject y position as measured from the upper-left of the previous subpart.  If first object subpart and this bit is 1, ignore subobject y position and use 0.
		0x02-0x03:	subobject x position, see also bits 6 and 7 of byte 0x01 (little endian)
		0x04-0x05:	subobject y position, see also bits 6 and 7 of byte 0x01 (little endian)
		0x06:		unused
		0x07-0x08:	bitfield (little endian)
			bit0-2:		unused (not set)
			bit3-4:
				00: If both bits 3 and 4 are 0, then subobject contains no trigger area (conceivably it may overwrite existing trigger area in the level as well).
				10: If bit 3 is 0 and bit 4 is 1, then subobject is definitely contains a trigger area.  This method of indication is used by exits, full-waters, and ice.
				11: If both bits 3 and 4 are 1, then subobject contains no trigger area.  Instead, they seem to be always things that you can click on, such as the arrows in a cannon object, or the "release button" for the swing chain.
				01: Finally, if bit 3 is 1 and bit 4 is 0, then subobject may contain a trigger area.  In this case you need to look at byte 0x00 of the subobject (aka "interaction type") for full determination.  It appears that if the interaction type has values from 0x06 to 0x0c (inclusive), then subobject functions like a trigger area; otherwise they function as other things.
				Again, in all cases above where I say "subobject contains no trigger area", it may still be that the subobject can actually overwrite (ie. cancel out) existing trigger area in a level, within the 16x8 tile where the subobject's upper-left corner is located.
			bit5-8:		trigger area x-offset
			bit9-11:	trigger area y-offset
			bit12-13:
				00: trigger area is 16x8 (ie. takes up the full tile)
				01: trigger area is 1x1 (ie. single pixel) at (x-offset, y-offset)
				10: trigger area is 5x5 centered at (x-offset, y-offset)
				11: trigger area is 9x9 centered at (x-offset, y-offset)
				With one further proviso:  any parts of the square given by the above table that lies outside the 16x8 tile area, those parts are clipped.  Another way to think of it is, if the pixel lies outside of the 16x8 tile area, it is not controlled by the object subpart in question, but possibly some other subpart of either this object or some other object in the level. See list of examples in Appendix E.
			bit14-15:
				00: normal
				01: water reaction
				10: ice surface reaction
				11: causes no effect on lemmings (ie. no exiting, drowning, slipping, nothing) and is not used by any objects in the game
		0x09:		solidity (?) (bitfield) (0x10 steel; 0x40 background; 0x00 special/event)
		0x0a:		graphics ID (from L2BI, or L2SI if in byte 0x0b special bit5 is set and bit7 is not set)
		0x0b:		bitfield
			bit0-3:		unused (not set)
			bit4:		permanent animation flag (as opposed to animation on trigger)
			bit5:		for objects with special L2SS graphics only
			bit6:		only ever used by two chain components each
			bit7:		invisible flag (?)

Appendix A: (L2SS) layer arrangement description
each layer N contains pixel information:
- Nth layer (counting begins at 0) contains the data for the pixels with x-position 4n+N, n is any non-negative integer
- each layer stores a list of data of the following form:
	1st byte: definition byte
		otherwise it belongs to the 'rest'
	rest: list of pixel information, i.e. color index IDs (from palette L2CL) (one byte each)
		number of pixel information bytes is indicated by the definition bytes

definition byte value table (first/higher nybble is H, second/lower nybble is L):
+ possibly not complete, but sufficient for producing apparently correct sprites from the original gfx
+ to get the x-position in the final sprite, it has to be multiplied by 4 and N has to be added
- in the beginning the current x/y-position is 0
- after a pixel is set, the x-position is increased by 1
- linebreak means x-position is reset, y-position increased by 1
0xFF:
	end of layer information
H<8; L=0:
	followed by H bytes of pixel information (H may be 0)
	after these pixels are set: linebreak
H<8; L<8:
	followed by L+H bytes of pixel information
H<8; L>=8:
	followed by H bytes of pixel information
	after these pixels are set: x-position increased by L-8
H>=8; H!=e; L<8:
	x-position increased by H-8
	followed by L bytes of pixel information
H=e; L>=8; L!=e:
	x-position increased by L-2
H>=8; H!=e; L>=8:
	effect unknown, not used in original gfx

Appendix E: (L2OB) examples for trigger area bytes (by ccexplore)
1) Suppose the word value is 0x1350.  Parsing the bitfields, we get an x-offset of 1010=10 (decimal), a y-offset of 001, and a size indicator of 01.  So we have a 1x1 trigger area at (10, 1) relative to the upper-left of the 16x8 tile [(0, 0) being the upper-leftmost pixel of that tile].

2) Suppose the word value is 0x2870.  Parsing the bitfields, we get an x-offset of 0011=3, a y-offset of 100=4, and a size indicator of 02.  So it's a 5x5 trigger area centered at (3, 4).  In other words, the upper-leftmost pixel of the area is (1, 2), and the lower-rightmost pixel is (5, 6).

3) Suppose the word value is 0x2830.  Similar to example #2, but x-offset is only 1 instead of 3.  So the clipping rule comes into effect, making the effective trigger area represented by this subpart to span only from (0, 2) to (3, 6), rather than (-1, 2) to (3, 6).  If you actually want the unclipped version, you'll need to put in a second object subpart to create a 2nd trigger area for the 16x8 tile above the current one, to make up for the part clipped out in the current subpart/tile.

4) Similarly, a word value of 0x29f0 has an x-offset of 15 instead of 3, so with the clipping rule, the trigger area spans from (13, 2) to (15, 6).  A word value of 0x2070 has a y-offset of 0 instead of 4, leading to the trigger area spanning from (1, 0) to (5, 2).  A word value of 0x2c70 has a y-offset of 6 instead of 4, and the trigger area would span from (1, 4) to (5, 7).

5) A word value of 0x0010, with a size indicator of 0, will cover the entire 16x8 tile area.  The values for x- and y-offsets have no effect--if you want, you can think of it as a 31x31 area with clipping applied, which would make the x- and y-offsets irrelevant.

6) A word value of 0x3db0 has an x-offset of 13, a y-offset of 6, and a size indicator of 3.  So the trigger area spans from (9, 2) to (15, 7).
