Lemmings 2 data documentation in L2SS format.
An implementation to dump specified files as targa can be found at http://geoo.digibase.ca/lemmings/l2ss.cpp
Extracted .png images at http://geoo.digibase.ca/lemmings/l2ss.7z

Some of the files are compressed while others are not; as the compressed ones are easily identified by the character sequence 'GCSM', I won't note which ones are compressed and which ones are not.
All documentation refers to uncompressed data; so you'll have to use Mindless' lem2zip to decompress the compressed files.

NOTE: the L2SS-L2SI sections are the same as in the tribe-specific
style files (see l2gfx.txt) except for parts marked with DIFF_IFF.

----------------
Stripped Format (intern.dat and masks.dat)
----------------
The same formap like .iff files, however DIFF_IFFs do not apply,
and the last four sections are missing,
requiring to use a palette from an external file.


----------------
Raw Format (icons.dat and panel.dat)
----------------
In panel.dat the data doesn't start at the beginning of this file,
therefore I refer to the section of data in this format in the file as 'subfile'

0x0000-0x0001:	number of entries N (little endian)
2*N bytes:	frame pointers relative to the beginning of the subfile
	2*N entries (frames), similar to L2SS:
	0x02-0x03: value 0
	0x04-0x05: value 0
	2*4 bytes: array of offsets (little endian) for each of the four pixel layers
		offset relative to the begin of the subfile
	4 layers of pixel information (variable size):
		each layer (for closer description see Appendix A):
			variable number of bytes: pixel data
			final byte 0xFF indicates end of layer information

----------------
VLEMMS Format
----------------
Header Info (12 bytes)
0x0000-0x0003: "FORM"
0x0004-0x0007: file size - 8 bytes (big endian)
0x0008-0x000b: "L2VG" (type: VG)

followed by a number (namely 0x7a) of sections labeled 'LM??' where ??
stands for some hexadecimal integer.

Lemming animation "LM??" section
0x0000-0x0003:	"LM??"
0x0004-0x0007:	section data size (big endian)
0x0008-0x0009:	number of entries N (little endian)
2*N bytes:	frame pointers relative to the beginning of the first entry
	2*N entries (frames), similar to L2SS:
	0x00-0x01: horizontal offset of the image from the top left corner of the animation coordinate system
	0x02-0x03: vertical offset of the image from the top left corner of the animation coordinate system
	0x04-0x05: frame pointer pointing to this fram + 6 (i.e. pointer to beginning of the size entries)
	0x06-0x07: x-size
	0x08-0x09: y-Size
	2*4 bytes: array of offsets (little endian) for each of the four pixel layers
		offset relative to the begin of the section + 8
	4 layers of pixel information (variable size):
		each layer (for closer description see Appendix A):
			variable number of bytes: pixel data
			final byte 0xFF indicates end of layer information

Appendix A: (L2SS) layer arrangement description
each layer N contains pixel information:
- Nth layer (counting begins at 0) contains the data for the pixels
  with x-position 4m+N (m is any non-negative integer) in sequential order
  i.e. to get the x-position in the final sprite, the 'internal' x position
  has to be multiplied by 4 and N has to be added
- each layer stores a list of data of the following form:
	1st byte: definition byte
	rest: list of pixel information, i.e. color index IDs (from palette L2PD) (one byte each)
		number of pixel information bytes is indicated by the definition bytes

definition byte value table (first/higher nybble is H, second/lower nybble is L):
- in the beginning the current x/y-position is 0
- after a pixel is set, the 'internal' x-position is increased by 1
- linebreak means x-position is reset, y-position increased by 1
0xFF:
	end of layer information
H<8; L=0:
	followed by H bytes of pixel information (H may be 0)
	after these pixels are set: linebreak
H<8; L<8:
	followed by L+H bytes of pixel information
H<8; L>=8:
	followed by H bytes of pixel information
	after these pixels are set: x-position increased by L-8
H>=8; H!=e; L<8:
	x-position increased by H-8
	followed by L bytes of pixel information
H=e; L>=8; L!=e:
	x-position increased by L-2
H>=8; H!=e; L>=8:
	effect unknown, not used in original gfx
