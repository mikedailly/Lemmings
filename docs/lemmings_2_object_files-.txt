some notes (guessing):

MAIN
NN 00 TT 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 05 00 SS 00

NN - number of graphics entries
TT - type(?)* -> effects animation
SS - sound effect

type value table
02: entry
03: exit
05: steel
06: water
09: deadly trap

SUB 
06 ZZ XX XX YY YY WW 68 II SS GG AA
first two bytes: likely event related
ZZ - 0x0f steel, 0x0a water

XX - rel. x-pos (+ trigger coord for last entry?)
YY - rel. y-pos (+ trigger coord for last entry?)
II - x-shifts trigger somehow sometimes
WW - creates weird gap under object
SS - solidity: 0x10 solid (steel), 0x40 background
GG - GFX-ID (ref. L2BI)
AA - lemming interaction event (?) - 0x10 permanent animation

XX=10) trigger pos & pos for 2nd steel tile
0x07-0x0a: 10 40 10 0D .. <-- 10 40 water; 10 00 exit; 10 80 water at pixel 8
10 00 08 00 <-- some x & y data (affects adding obj. of same kind left & right and alignment)
40 10 00 06 08 XX 00 YY 00 WW 68 II <-- XX/YY = trigger x/y-coord, WW creates weird gap under object, II x-shifts trigger somehow sometimes
